## Abstract

We analyze galaxy rotation curves and mass scaling relations within the Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework, a geometric model in which dynamical structure emerges from curvature-regulated motion rather than dark-matter halos or modified inertia. Using a 91-galaxy rotation-curve sample with no exclusions, we recover a tight Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation (BTFR) of the form  

M ∝ V^α  

with  

α = 2.719 ± 0.081  (R² = 0.9347),  

and the inverse relation  

V ∝ M^β  

with  

β = 0.344 ± 0.010.  

We show that this scaling arises naturally from a universal geometric mass–radius relation  

M(r) ∝ r^{1.878},  

which governs curvature saturation in the MTS ψ-field.

Extending this analysis, we examine the radial behavior of the enclosed mass exponent m(r) across a larger SPARC-derived sample and identify two distinct galaxy populations: systems whose m(r) profiles cross the MTS fixed point m* = 1.878, and systems that do not. We demonstrate that this crossing behavior is strongly correlated with galaxy mass, size, and rotation velocity, indicating that the MTS fixed point is a conditional geometric equilibrium rather than a universal radial invariant.

## 1. Introduction

The Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation (BTFR) links the baryonic mass of disk galaxies to their asymptotic rotation velocity via the empirical law  

M ∝ V^α.  

In ΛCDM, this relation emerges only after nontrivial tuning between halo mass, concentration, baryonic feedback, and angular momentum. In MOND, the slope α = 4 is imposed by construction. Neither framework predicts *why* a particular exponent should arise.

Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) provides a different explanation. In MTS, galaxy rotation curves emerge from curvature diffusion in a geometric motion field ψ, with asymptotic velocities arising through saturation rather than halo support or modified inertia. The framework predicts a universal structural exponent  

m = 1.878  

governing mass–radius relations, curvature accumulation, and velocity saturation.

## 2. MTS Rotation Curves and Geometric Saturation

In the MTS framework, the circular velocity profile of a disk galaxy is well described by  

v(r) = a (1 − exp(−b r)),  

where a ≡ V∞ is the asymptotic velocity and b⁻¹ is a curvature saturation scale. This form arises from ψ-field curvature damping and does not rely on dark-matter halo prescriptions or modified gravity.

## 3. Data and Methodology

### 3.1 Dataset

We analyze a sample of 91 galaxies drawn from SPARC and literature sources, spanning ultra-dwarfs to giant spirals. Published rotation curves and baryonic masses are used exactly as reported. No galaxies are excluded and no outlier filtering is applied.

### 3.2 Velocity Extraction

Each rotation curve is fit with the MTS saturation model. The asymptotic velocity V∞ is taken directly from the fitted parameter a, providing a uniform and physically motivated velocity definition across the entire sample.

### 3.3 Scaling Fits

Log–log regressions are performed for  

log M = A + α log V∞  

and  

log V∞ = B + β log M.

## 4. The Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation from MTS Geometry

### 4.1 Results

The BTFR is recovered with  

α = 2.719 ± 0.081  (R² = 0.9347)  

and  

β = 0.344 ± 0.010  (R² = 0.9347),  

satisfying the inverse symmetry β ≈ 1/α across the full mass range from dwarf galaxies to giant spirals.

### 4.2 Analytic Origin of the BTFR Exponent

MTS predicts a universal geometric mass–radius relation  

M ∝ R^m,  

with  

m = 1.878,  

implying  

R ∝ M^{1/m}.  

Using the geometric virial balance  

V∞² ∝ M / R,  

we obtain  

V∞ ∝ M^{(1 − 1/m)/2}.  

Inverting yields the BTFR exponent  

α = \frac{2}{1 − 1/m}.  

For  

m = 1.878,  

this gives  

α ≈ 2.72,  

in excellent agreement with the observed value  

α = 2.719 ± 0.081.  

Thus the BTFR exponent is not fundamental, but emerges algebraically from the geometric fixed point of the MTS framework.

## 5. Radial Mass-Exponent Profiles and the Conditional Fixed Point

### 5.1 Local Mass Exponent m(r)

We define the local enclosed mass exponent  

m(r) = d log M(<r) / d log r,  

computed using sliding radial windows across each galaxy’s rotation curve. Galaxies are classified by whether m(r) intersects the MTS fixed point  

m* = 1.878.

### 5.2 Crossing vs. Non-Crossing Galaxies

Two distinct populations emerge:

**Crossing galaxies** are typically smaller, less massive, and slower-rotating systems. Their m(r) profiles begin at high values (m ≈ 2.3–2.5 at r/r_max ≈ 0.1), decrease with radius, and cross m* at r/r_max ≈ 0.3 before continuing to fall below it.

**Non-crossing galaxies** are larger, more massive, and faster-rotating systems. Their m(r) profiles begin near m ≈ 1.3–1.5 and remain below m* at all observed radii.

This conditional behavior resolves the apparent tension between the existence of a global BTFR scaling and the observed diversity of local m(r) profiles within individual galaxies.

---

### 5.3 Correlation with Global Properties

Non-crossing galaxies are, on average, approximately five times more massive, twice as large, and 1.6 times faster-rotating than crossing galaxies. The presence or absence of an m(r) crossing is therefore a strong function of galaxy scale rather than data quality or sampling.

---

### 5.4 Interpretation

The MTS fixed point m* = 1.878 is not a universal radial attractor. Instead, it represents a conditional geometric equilibrium. Smaller galaxies overshoot this value in their inner regions and relax through it, while larger galaxies remain in a sub-m* regime throughout their disks.

This behavior does not contradict the BTFR: the BTFR reflects global mass–radius structure governed by m = 1.878, even when the fixed point is not locally realized at all radii.

---

## 6. Comparison with ΛCDM and MOND

ΛCDM requires halo tuning to reproduce BTFR slopes and does not predict a universal mass exponent. MOND enforces α = 4 by construction, inconsistent with the present dataset. MTS predicts both the BTFR exponent and its conditional radial manifestation from a single geometric principle.

---

## 7. Conclusion

We show that the Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation arises naturally from Motion–TimeSpace geometry, with  

α = 2.719 ± 0.081  

derived from the universal mass–radius exponent  

m = 1.878.  

The same exponent governs internal galaxy structure through the radial mass-exponent profile m(r), but manifests conditionally rather than universally.

Smaller galaxies cross the MTS fixed point as part of geometric relaxation, while larger galaxies do not. Together, these results unify global scaling laws and internal galactic dynamics within a single geometric framework, without invoking dark matter halos or modified gravity.
