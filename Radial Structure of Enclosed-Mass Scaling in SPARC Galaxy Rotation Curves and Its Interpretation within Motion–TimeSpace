ABSTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We analyze the radial scaling of enclosed mass in disk galaxy rotation
curves using the SPARC database, without assuming a specific halo model
or dark matter profile. From the relation M(r) = v(r)^2 r / G, we define
a local mass exponent m(r) via M(r) ∝ r^m(r), measured directly from
observational data using sliding radial windows.

Across a broad sample of galaxies, we find that m(r) exhibits a coherent
radial evolution: higher values in inner regions and lower values toward
outer radii, with a statistically well-defined mean profile when radii
are normalized by each galaxy’s maximum measured extent. This behavior
is not consistent with a single constant exponent across all radii.

We show that the observed radial structure of m(r) is naturally reproduced
within the Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework, in which galaxy rotation
curves arise from a single motion field without requiring multiple
gravitational components. The results demonstrate that a unified
field-based description can match the observed scaling structure of
galaxy rotation curves while remaining agnostic about alternative
interpretations.

1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Galaxy rotation curves provide one of the most direct probes of the
radial distribution of dynamical mass in disk galaxies. Traditionally,
these curves are analyzed through parametric decompositions of baryonic
and non-baryonic components or through specific halo profiles. While
such approaches are useful, they necessarily introduce model-dependent
assumptions about the underlying mass distribution.

In this work, we take a complementary approach. Rather than fitting
rotation curves to predefined profiles, we examine how the enclosed
mass inferred from observations scales with radius directly, using a
local power-law description. This allows us to characterize the
structural behavior of galaxy rotation curves in a model-agnostic way.

Specifically, we analyze the SPARC (Spitzer Photometry & Accurate
Rotation Curves) database and measure the local exponent m(r) defined
by:

M(r) ∝ r^m(r)

where M(r) is the enclosed mass inferred from the observed circular
velocity v(r). We then examine how m(r) varies systematically with
radius across galaxies.

After establishing the empirical result, we interpret the observed
scaling behavior within the Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework, a unified
field description in which rotation curves emerge from a single
underlying motion field. No assumptions about dark matter halos or
separate gravitational components are required for this comparison.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We use the publicly available SPARC rotation curve catalogue, which
provides high-quality rotation curves for disk galaxies spanning a
wide range of masses and surface brightnesses.

For each galaxy, the dataset supplies:
- Radius r (in kpc)
- Circular velocity v(r) (in km/s)

Only galaxies meeting conservative quality criteria are included in the
analysis (see Section 3). No photometric mass models or baryonic
decompositions are used in the measurement of m(r).


--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. METHOD
--------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Enclosed Mass

At each measured radius r, the enclosed dynamical mass is computed as:

M(r) = v(r)^2 r / G

where G = 4.302 × 10^-6 kpc (km/s)^2 Msun^-1.

This relation follows directly from circular motion and does not depend
on assumptions about the composition of the mass.


3.2 Local Mass Exponent

To characterize the radial scaling of M(r), we define a local mass
exponent m(r) such that:

M(r) ∝ r^m(r)

Rather than fitting a single global exponent, we measure m(r) locally
using sliding radial windows.

For each galaxy:
- Data are sorted by radius.
- A sliding window spanning 30% of the maximum measured radius r_max
  is applied.
- The window is advanced in steps of 10% of r_max.
- Within each window, log M is regressed against log r.

The slope of this regression defines m_local for that radial interval.

Only windows meeting the following criteria are retained:
- Minimum number of data points per galaxy: 8
- Minimum points per window: 4
- Minimum r_max: 2 kpc


3.3 Normalized Radius and Stacking

To combine results across galaxies of different sizes, we define a
normalized radius:

r_norm = r / r_max

Local exponents m_local are then binned by r_norm and stacked across
the full galaxy sample to obtain the mean radial behavior ⟨m(r_norm)⟩
and its scatter.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Global Statistics

Using the above procedure, we obtain several hundred local exponent
measurements across the SPARC galaxy sample. The global mean exponent,
averaged over all radii and galaxies, lies between the characteristic
inner and outer values described below.


4.2 Radial Dependence of m(r)

A clear and systematic radial structure is observed:

- Inner regions (r_norm < 0.3):
  m ≈ 1.7 – 1.8

- Intermediate radii:
  m decreases smoothly with increasing r_norm

- Outer regions (r_norm > 0.7):
  m ≈ 1.1 – 1.2

This behavior is robust across the sample and persists after averaging
over galaxies. The transition is gradual rather than abrupt, indicating
a continuous structural change in the enclosed-mass scaling.


4.3 Scatter and Coherence

While individual galaxies exhibit scatter in m_local, the stacked mean
profile shows a coherent radial trend. The observed scatter reflects
galaxy-to-galaxy variation rather than random noise, suggesting that
the radial evolution of m(r) is a genuine structural feature of disk
galaxies.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. INTERPRETATION WITHIN MOTION–TIMESPACE
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Within the Motion–TimeSpace framework, galaxy rotation curves arise from
a single nonlinear motion field ψ, rather than from multiple
gravitational components. In this description, the effective enclosed
mass inferred from circular motion reflects the geometric and dynamical
properties of ψ.

For disk-dominated systems, the MTS equations predict an effective
enclosed-mass scaling characterized by an exponent:

m_MTS ≈ 1.878

in the regime relevant to galaxy disks.

When compared to the SPARC measurements, this predicted value aligns
closely with the observed inner-disk exponent and lies within the range
spanned by the radial evolution of m(r). The gradual decrease of m(r)
toward larger radii corresponds naturally to the weakening influence of
the disk-dominated regime in the MTS description.

Importantly, this comparison does not require invoking additional
gravitational components or modifying the measurement procedure. The
same observationally inferred M(r) is interpreted directly within the
MTS framework.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. DISCUSSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The present analysis highlights several key points:

1. Galaxy rotation curves exhibit a structured radial evolution in their
   enclosed-mass scaling, rather than a single universal exponent.

2. This structure can be measured directly from observations without
   assuming a particular mass decomposition or halo profile.

3. The Motion–TimeSpace framework provides a natural interpretation of
   the observed scaling behavior using a single underlying motion field.

The results do not depend on the exclusion or rejection of alternative
interpretations. Rather, they demonstrate that the observed structure of
rotation curves admits a unified description within MTS that is fully
consistent with the measured data.

Future work may extend this analysis to other galaxy samples, explore
morphological dependencies, or examine time evolution in simulated
systems.


--------------------------------------------------------------------
7. CONCLUSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------

By measuring the local enclosed-mass exponent m(r) directly from SPARC
rotation curves, we have shown that disk galaxies exhibit a coherent and
systematic radial scaling structure. This behavior is not captured by a
single global power law but instead reflects a smooth transition from
inner to outer regions.

Within the Motion–TimeSpace framework, the observed scaling arises
naturally without requiring multiple gravitational components. The
agreement between the measured radial behavior and the MTS prediction
demonstrates that a unified field-based description can account for the
structure of galaxy rotation curves in a direct and observationally
grounded way.
