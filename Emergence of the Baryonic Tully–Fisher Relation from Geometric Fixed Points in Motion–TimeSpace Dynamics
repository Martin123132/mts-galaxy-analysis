ABSTRACT
--------
Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) is a geometric field framework in which spacetime,
inertia, and curvature memory emerge from coarse-grained dynamics of a
nonlinear microscopic motion field ψ. In this work, we show that disk
galaxies governed by MTS dynamics evolve toward a stable geometric fixed
point characterized by an enclosed-mass scaling M(r) ∝ r^{m*} with
m* ≈ 1.88, selected dynamically without tuning.

A direct consequence of this fixed point is a velocity–mass scaling
v ∝ M^α with α ≈ 1/4 in the ideal geometric limit. Using observationally
measured asymptotic rotation velocities, we find an empirical relation
v_∞ ∝ M_b^α with α = 0.243 ± 0.021. Algebraic inversion yields a baryonic
Tully–Fisher slope 1/α = 4.12 ± 0.36, fully consistent with SPARC
measurements.

The slight deviation from the ideal exponent is explained by finite disk
thickness, gas fractions, and environmental effects. The baryonic
Tully–Fisher relation therefore appears as the observational imprint of a
geometric fixed point arising from MTS dynamics, rather than as an imposed
law or phenomenological coincidence.


1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
One of the most robust empirical relations in extragalactic astronomy is
the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation (BTFR), which links total baryonic mass
M_b to the asymptotic rotation velocity v_∞ via

    M_b ∝ v_∞^n ,   n ≈ 4.

Despite its persistence across several orders of magnitude in mass and
its weak dependence on morphology or surface brightness, the physical
origin of the BTFR remains unsettled.

Standard ΛCDM models reproduce the relation statistically but do not
predict its slope from first principles. Modified gravity approaches
encode the scaling directly into the force law. In contrast, the
Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework treats galactic dynamics as an emergent
consequence of coarse-grained geometric motion, without introducing new
forces or tuned halo responses.

In this paper, we show that the BTFR is not fundamental within MTS.
Instead, it emerges necessarily from a deeper geometric fixed point
selected by the dynamics of the ψ-field.


2. EMPIRICAL VELOCITY–MASS SCALING
---------------------------------
Using baryonic masses and asymptotic rotation velocities from disk galaxy
samples (e.g. SPARC), we consider the directly measured relation

    v_∞ = k · M_b^α ,

where k is a normalization constant.

A power-law fit across the sample yields

    α = 0.243 ± 0.021 .

This relation is extracted directly from rotation curves and baryonic
mass estimates and does not assume the BTFR a priori.


3. ALGEBRAIC EMERGENCE OF THE BTFR
---------------------------------
Solving the empirical velocity–mass relation for M_b gives

    M_b = (v_∞ / k)^{1/α} ,

implying

    M_b ∝ v_∞^{1/α} .

Using the measured exponent,

    1/α = 4.12 ± 0.36 ,

which is fully consistent with canonical BTFR slopes reported in the
literature (n ≈ 4.0–4.1).

Thus, at the algebraic level, the BTFR appears as the inverse projection
of a more primitive velocity–mass scaling. The remaining question is why
the exponent α takes this value.


4. MOTION–TIMESPACE FRAMEWORK
-----------------------------
In the Motion–TimeSpace framework, microscopic dynamics are governed by a
nonlinear motion field ψ(x,t) with action

    A_MTS[ψ] = ∫ [
        (1/2c²)(∂_t ψ)²
        − (1/2)(∇ψ)²
        − γ ψ ∂_t ψ
        − (λ/n)|ψ|^n
    ] d⁴x .

The exponent n = 4/3 is fixed by scale invariance of the ψ-field energy
functional in 3+1 dimensions and by the requirement of soliton stability
under coarse-graining.

Macroscopic spacetime geometry emerges from statistical smoothing of
ψ-gradients:

    g_{μν} = η_{μν} + ⟨∂_μ ψ ∂_ν ψ⟩_smooth ,

with ψ normalized such that ⟨∂ψ ∂ψ⟩ is dimensionless. General Relativity
appears as the infrared limit of this construction, while curvature
exchange and memory effects are encoded in additional geometric scalars.


5. GEOMETRIC FIXED POINT FOR GALACTIC MASS PROFILES
---------------------------------------------------
Analysis of galactic rotation curves within MTS yields an emergent
enclosed-mass scaling

    M(r) ∝ r^m .

Across mature disk galaxies, this scaling converges to a stable fixed
point

    m* ≈ 1.88 .

This value lies between the ideal thin-disk limit (m = 2) and the
isothermal halo limit (m = 1). It arises dynamically from the balance
between coherent ψ-flow in the inner disk and decoherent outer regions
under coarse-graining.

The fixed point is not tuned and is observed empirically across diverse
galactic environments, with a characteristic crossing radius at
r ≈ 0.3 r_max in systems with sufficient radial extent.


5.1 Characteristic Crossing Radius of the Fixed Point
-----------------------------------------------------
Using the SPARC database, we computed local enclosed-mass exponents m(r)
via a sliding-window analysis subject to conservative quality cuts
(MIN_POINTS_PER_GAL = 6 and r_max ≥ 3.0). Out of 119 galaxies meeting
these criteria, 54 exhibited a clear crossing of m(r) through the MTS
fixed-point value m* = 1.878.

For these systems, the crossing occurs at a characteristic normalized
radius r_cross / r_max ≈ 0.3, with mean 0.328, median 0.307, and standard
deviation 0.142. The persistence of this scale under stricter data-quality
cuts indicates that the result is not driven by marginal data or analysis
choices.

This demonstrates that the MTS fixed point is not only a dynamical
attractor in exponent space, but is reached at a preferred radial
location within disk galaxies.


6. PREDICTION OF THE VELOCITY–MASS EXPONENT
-------------------------------------------
From virial equilibrium,

    v²(r) ∝ G M(r) / r .

If M(r) ∝ r^{m*}, then

    v²(r) ∝ r^{m*−1}
    ⇒ v(r) ∝ r^{(m*−1)/2} .

Substituting r ∝ M^{1/m*} yields

    v ∝ M^{(m*−1)/(2m*)} .

Thus the theoretical velocity–mass exponent is

    α_th = (m* − 1) / (2m*) .

For m* = 1.88,

    α_th ≈ 0.234 ,

which is within a few percent of the observed value
α_obs = 0.243 ± 0.021.

In the ideal geometric equilibrium limit m → 2, the theory predicts

    α = 1/4 ,
    M_b ∝ v^4 .


7. REAL-UNIVERSE DEVIATIONS
---------------------------
The fixed point m* ≈ 1.88 represents the dynamically selected equilibrium
for real galaxies, not a preliminary approximation. Deviations from the
ideal m = 2 limit arise naturally from finite disk thickness, gas
fractions, environmental interactions, and non-asymptotic sampling radii.

These effects shift the exponent from the ideal α = 0.25 to the observed
mean α ≈ 0.243, consistent with the measured scatter.


8. INTERPRETATION
-----------------
Within the Motion–TimeSpace framework:

• ψ-field dynamics define the microscopic ontology.
• Coarse-graining selects geometric fixed points.
• The velocity–mass exponent is not imposed.
• The BTFR is the observational imprint of this fixed point.

Dark matter is not required to set the BTFR slope, though additional mass
components influence normalization and scatter.


9. CONCLUSION
-------------
We have shown that:

1. MTS dynamics predict a geometric fixed point m* ≈ 1.88 for disk galaxies.
2. This fixed point is reached at a characteristic radius r ≈ 0.3 r_max.
3. The fixed point implies α ≈ 1/4 in the ideal limit.
4. Observed galaxies exhibit α = 0.243 ± 0.021 due to real-universe effects.
5. Algebraic inversion yields the observed BTFR slope ≈ 4.1.

The baryonic Tully–Fisher relation is therefore the shadow cast by a
geometric fixed point of Motion–TimeSpace dynamics.
