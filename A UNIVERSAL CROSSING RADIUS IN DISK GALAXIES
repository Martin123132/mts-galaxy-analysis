ABSTRACT
------------------------------------------------------------

We investigate the radius at which enclosed dark matter mass equals enclosed
baryonic mass in disk galaxies, defined as the crossing radius r_cross.
Using high-quality SPARC rotation curves, we identify a narrow and
morphology-dependent scaling between r_cross and the stellar half-mass
radius R_*.

We test this relation using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations.
When restricted to disk-dominated galaxies, simulated systems reproduce
the observed scaling with statistical consistency. The median normalized
crossing radius agrees with the SPARC value within < 1σ.

Including bulge-dominated galaxies significantly broadens the distribution,
explaining apparent discrepancies reported in earlier simulation-based
studies. These results indicate that the crossing-radius relation is a
robust structural property of disk galaxies and that residual tensions in
ΛCDM simulations arise primarily from morphology mixing rather than incorrect
radial mass scaling.

1. INTRODUCTION
------------------------------------------------------------

The radial distribution of baryonic and dark matter in galaxies remains a
central problem in astrophysics. While ΛCDM simulations reproduce large-scale
structure successfully, persistent discrepancies appear on galactic scales,
including overly concentrated dark matter halos and incorrect morphological
fractions.

Rotation curves provide a direct probe of enclosed mass profiles. In this
work, we focus on a particularly simple and physically transparent quantity:
the radius at which baryonic and dark matter masses become equal.

Unlike asymptotic velocity measures or detailed parametric profile fitting,
the crossing radius depends only on cumulative mass ordering. This makes it
robust against noise, resolution effects, and model assumptions.

Observational evidence from the SPARC database suggests a near-universal
relation between this crossing radius and the stellar scale length in disk
galaxies. Here, we test whether this relation is reproduced in modern
hydrodynamical simulations and clarify the role of galaxy morphology.

2. DATA
------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 SPARC Rotation Curves

We use the SPARC database of high-quality galaxy rotation curves. Galaxies
are selected based on sufficient radial extent and data quality to allow
reliable enclosed mass reconstruction.

Baryonic and total mass profiles are derived directly from the observed
rotation curves using standard dynamical relations.

2.2 IllustrisTNG Simulations

Simulated galaxies are drawn from the IllustrisTNG project at redshift z = 0.
Subhalos are selected in the stellar mass range:

  10⁹ M☉ ≤ M_* ≤ 10¹¹ M☉

This range matches the SPARC sample. Particle-level data are used to compute
enclosed dark matter and baryonic mass profiles.

Galaxy morphology is classified using a kinematic and structural proxy based
on stellar mass distribution and half-mass radius, separating disk-dominated
and bulge-dominated systems.


------------------------------------------------------------
3. METHODOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------

3.1 Enclosed Mass Profiles

For each galaxy, cumulative enclosed mass profiles are constructed:

  M_dm(r)   = enclosed dark matter mass
  M_bar(r)  = enclosed baryonic mass (stars + gas)

Particles (or inferred mass elements) are sorted by radius, and cumulative
sums are computed.

3.2 Definition of the Crossing Radius

The crossing radius r_cross is defined as the smallest radius satisfying:

  M_dm(r) = M_bar(r)

Linear interpolation between adjacent radial bins is used to obtain
sub-bin precision.

3.3 Normalization

To remove trivial mass scaling, the crossing radius is normalized by the
stellar half-mass radius R_*:

  r̃_cross = r_cross / R_*

3.4 Statistical Treatment

Distributions are summarized using medians rather than means.
Scatter is quantified using the median absolute deviation (MAD).

Bootstrap resampling is used to estimate confidence intervals and to assess
statistical significance.


------------------------------------------------------------
4. RESULTS
------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 SPARC Observations

Disk galaxies in the SPARC sample exhibit a narrow distribution of normalized
crossing radii:

  r̃_cross ≈ 0.36 ± 0.05

This value shows little dependence on stellar mass.

4.2 IllustrisTNG — Full Sample

When all morphologies are included, TNG galaxies show a broad and skewed
distribution of r̃_cross, with a median significantly larger than the SPARC
value and substantial scatter.

4.3 IllustrisTNG — Disk-Only Sample

Restricting the analysis to disk-dominated systems yields:

  Number of galaxies: 16
  Median r̃_cross    : 0.308
  68% CI             : [0.196, 0.410]
  Offset from SPARC  : −0.052
  Significance       : 0.54σ

The SPARC prediction lies well within the 68% confidence interval.

4.4 Bootstrap Validation

Bootstrap resampling confirms that the observed agreement is robust and not
driven by small-number statistics.


------------------------------------------------------------
5. DISCUSSION
------------------------------------------------------------

The agreement between observed and simulated disk galaxies indicates that
the crossing-radius relation is a genuine structural property of disk systems.

The apparent disagreement observed in full simulation samples arises from
the inclusion of bulge-dominated galaxies, which are known to be overproduced
and overly concentrated in ΛCDM simulations.

This result separates two issues often conflated:

  1) Radial mass scaling — reproduced correctly for disks
  2) Morphological population statistics — still problematic in simulations


------------------------------------------------------------
6. CONCLUSIONS
------------------------------------------------------------

• Disk galaxies exhibit a near-universal crossing radius relative to stellar
  scale length.

• This relation is reproduced in IllustrisTNG when morphology is controlled.

• Discrepancies in simulations primarily stem from morphology mixing, not
  incorrect radial mass physics.

• The crossing radius provides a simple, robust diagnostic for comparing
  galaxy structure across observations and simulations.
