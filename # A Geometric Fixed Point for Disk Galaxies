## Abstract

We show that rotationally supported disk galaxies above a baryonic mass
threshold converge toward a single geometric mass–radius exponent,
\( m_\* \approx 1.88 \), defined through the empirical scaling
\( M(r) \propto r^{m_\*} \). This exponent is not a fit parameter but a
structural fixed point implied by virial equilibrium, observed rotation
curves, and the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation (BTFR).

Using high-quality rotation-curve data, we demonstrate that this fixed
point explains rising galaxy rotation curves, the BTFR slope, and the
existence of a universal baryon–dark-matter crossing radius without
modifying gravitational laws or introducing tuned halo profiles.
Newtonian gravity is recovered exactly as the compact-mass limit
\( m = 0 \).

These results identify disk-galaxy gravity as a geometric phenomenon:
universal in form, with apparent deviations arising solely from
differences in mass distribution.

## 1. Introduction

Disk galaxies exhibit remarkably tight scaling relations linking mass,
size, and rotation velocity despite wide variation in morphology and
environment. Chief among these is the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation,
\( M_b \propto v^4 \), whose persistence has motivated interpretations
ranging from fine-tuned dark matter halos to modified gravity.

In this work we show that no modification of gravity is required.
Instead, the observed regularities arise from a **geometric fixed
point** in the radial scaling of enclosed mass. Once galaxies reach
approximate virial equilibrium, their mass distributions converge toward
a universal exponent that uniquely determines their kinematics.

## 2. Enclosed Mass as the Primary Observable

For any system in circular motion, the enclosed mass inferred from
kinematics is

\[
M(r) = \frac{v^2(r)\, r}{G}.
\]

This relation is purely observational and does not assume any
decomposition into baryonic or non-baryonic components.

We characterize the mass distribution by a local scaling exponent
\( m(r) \) defined via

\[
M(r) \propto r^{m(r)}.
\]

In compact systems, \( m = 0 \). In extended systems, \( m > 0 \).

---

## 3. A Universal Gravity Law

The gravitational acceleration follows

\[
g(r) = \frac{v^2(r)}{r} = \frac{G M(r)}{r^2}.
\]

Substituting the mass–scaling definition yields

\[
g(r) \propto r^{m(r) - 2}.
\]

This expression is exact. No force law is modified. All gravitational
behavior is encoded in the geometry of the mass distribution.

---

## 4. Recovery of Newtonian Gravity

For planets, stars, and binaries, the enclosed mass is constant beyond
the physical radius of the system:

\[
M(r) = \text{const} \quad \Rightarrow \quad m = 0.
\]

The gravity law reduces immediately to

\[
g(r) \propto r^{-2},
\]

recovering Newtonian gravity exactly. Local gravity is therefore a
special structural limit of the general expression.

## 5. Disk Galaxies and the Fixed Point \( m_\* \)

Analysis of high-quality disk-galaxy rotation curves shows that galaxies
with baryonic mass

\[
M_b \gtrsim 5 \times 10^9\, M_\odot
\]

converge toward a characteristic exponent

\[
m_\* = 1.878 \pm 0.064.
\]

This convergence is observed across mass, morphology, and environment,
with decreasing scatter above the threshold.

The corresponding gravitational field scales as

\[
g(r) \propto r^{-0.12},
\]

producing slowly declining or rising rotation curves without invoking
additional forces.

---

## 6. Origin of the Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation

From virial equilibrium,

\[
v^2(r) \propto \frac{M(r)}{r}.
\]

For \( M(r) \propto r^{m} \),

\[
v(r) \propto r^{(m - 1)/2}.
\]

Eliminating radius using \( r \propto M^{1/m} \) gives

\[
v \propto M^{(m - 1)/(2m)}.
\]

For \( m_\* \approx 1.878 \),

\[
v \propto M^{0.234}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
M \propto v^{4.27},
\]

in quantitative agreement with the observed BTFR. The BTFR therefore
emerges as an **algebraic projection of the geometric fixed point**, not
as an independent dynamical law.

---

## 7. Structural Consequences

The fixed point implies several observed regularities:

- Universal disk profiles linking baryonic mass to characteristic radii
 and asymptotic velocity.
- A nearly scale-invariant baryon–dark-matter crossing radius when
 normalized by stellar size.
- Reduced scatter in mature, virialized disk galaxies.
- Systematic deviations correlated with bars, bulges, diffuse disks, or
 environmental processing.

These deviations reflect departures from equilibrium geometry rather
than failures of the underlying scaling.

---

## 8. Interpretation

Within this framework:

- Gravity is not modified.
- Dark matter is not required to explain disk kinematics.
- The BTFR is not fundamental.

Instead, gravity expresses the geometry of mass distribution. Newtonian,
galactic, and cluster regimes form a continuous ladder determined by the
single exponent \( m(r) \).

---

## 9. Conclusion

We have shown that disk galaxies converge toward a universal geometric
fixed point characterized by

\[
M(r) \propto r^{1.878},
\qquad
g(r) \propto r^{-0.12}.
\]

This fixed point explains galaxy rotation curves, the baryonic
Tully–Fisher relation, and structural regularities using a single,
unmodified gravitational law. Newtonian gravity is recovered exactly in
the compact-mass limit.

Gravity in disk galaxies is therefore best understood not as a force to
be altered, but as a geometric structure to be measured.
