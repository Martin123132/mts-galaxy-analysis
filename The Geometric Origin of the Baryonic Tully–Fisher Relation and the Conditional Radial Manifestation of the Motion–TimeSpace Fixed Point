Abstract
------------------------------------------------------------

We compute the baryonic Tully–Fisher relation (BTFR) for a 91-galaxy
rotation-curve sample using asymptotic velocities extracted from the
Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) curvature-diffusion model. Fitting the relation

    M ∝ V∞^α

yields

    α = 2.719 ± 0.081   (R² = 0.9347),

with the inverse fit

    V∞ ∝ M^β,   β = 0.344 ± 0.010,

demonstrating statistical inversion symmetry. The exponent arises
analytically from the universal MTS geometric scaling
M ∝ R^m with m ≈ 1.878, rather than from dark-matter halo tuning or
modified inertia.

Extending the analysis to radial mass-exponent profiles m(r), we show
that the MTS fixed point m = 1.878 is not universally realized at all
radii. Smaller galaxies typically relax through the fixed point,
while larger, more massive galaxies remain in a sub-fixed-point regime.
This conditional manifestation resolves apparent diversity in rotation
curves while preserving a unified geometric origin for global scaling
relations.

1. Introduction
------------------------------------------------------------

The baryonic Tully–Fisher relation (BTFR) links the baryonic mass of a
galaxy to its characteristic rotation velocity. Empirically, it is
often written as

    M ∝ V^n,

with n ≈ 4 when velocities are defined using observational proxies such
as Vmax or Vflat. In ΛCDM, reproducing this relation requires halo
concentration tuning and feedback prescriptions, while MOND enforces
the slope by construction.

Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) provides an alternative explanation. In MTS,
flat rotation curves and scaling relations emerge from curvature-regulated
dynamics of a nonlinear motion field ψ, without invoking dark matter
or modified inertia. Velocities saturate geometrically rather than
through halo equilibrium.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. Microscopic ψ-Field Dynamics
------------------------------------------------------------

The fundamental MTS action is

    A_MTS = ∫ [ (1/2c²)(∂tψ)² − (1/2)(∇ψ)²
               − (γ/2) ψ ∂tψ − (λ/n)|ψ|^n ] d⁴x.

Variation yields the nonlinear dissipative wave equation

    ∂t²ψ − c²∇²ψ + γ∂tψ + λ|ψ|^{n−1}ψ = 0.

Dimensional consistency and soliton stability in three spatial
dimensions fix the nonlinearity to n = 4/3, consistent with Derrick-type
stability constraints. This exponent is not tuned; it is required for
localized, long-lived structures.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. Velocity Saturation in MTS
------------------------------------------------------------

At galactic scales, the ψ-field dynamics produce curvature-regulated
rotation curves of the form

    v(r) = a [1 − exp(−b r)],

where a = V∞ is the asymptotic saturation velocity and b sets the
geometric saturation scale. This form emerges generically from curvature
diffusion and damping and does not depend on halo profiles.

The saturation velocity V∞ provides a well-defined, model-internal
velocity observable that can be extracted uniformly across galaxies.

4. The Baryonic Tully–Fisher Relation
------------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Data and Methodology

We analyze a 91-galaxy sample drawn from SPARC and literature sources,
covering ultra-dwarfs to giant spirals. No galaxies are excluded and no
outlier filtering is applied.

For each galaxy, the MTS velocity model is fit directly to the observed
rotation curve, and the asymptotic velocity V∞ is extracted. Two log–log
fits are then performed:

    log M = A + α log V∞
    log V∞ = B + β log M.

4.2 Results

The mass-side fit yields

    α = 2.719 ± 0.081   (R² = 0.9347),

while the inverse fit gives

    β = 0.344 ± 0.010   (R² = 0.9347).

The approximate relation β ≈ 1/α demonstrates inversion symmetry,
showing that the scaling is robust to the choice of dependent variable.

------------------------------------------------------------
5. Conditional Radial Manifestation of the MTS Fixed Point
------------------------------------------------------------

To probe the internal structure of galaxies, we examine the local
enclosed-mass exponent

    m(r) = d ln M(r) / d ln r.

Across the sample, two distinct behaviors emerge:

• Crossing galaxies:
  Smaller, less massive, slower-rotating systems typically begin with
  m(r) ≳ 2 in their inner regions. As radius increases, m(r) decreases
  and crosses the MTS fixed point m = 1.878 at r/rmax ≈ 0.3, continuing
  to fall below it in the outer disk.

• Non-crossing galaxies:
  Larger, more massive, faster-rotating galaxies exhibit m(r) values
  that start near or below 1.5 and remain consistently below m = 1.878
  across their observed radial extent.

This demonstrates that the MTS fixed point is not a mandatory value at
all radii. Instead, it represents an equilibrium attractor reached only
under certain dynamical conditions. Small galaxies relax through it;
large galaxies are curvature-saturated and remain sub-fixed-point.

This conditional behavior resolves the apparent diversity of rotation
curves without abandoning a unified geometric framework.

------------------------------------------------------------
6. Geometric Origin of the BTFR Exponent
------------------------------------------------------------

In MTS, the universal geometric scaling

    M ∝ R^m,   with m ≈ 1.878,

emerges from the coarse-grained ψ-field dynamics.

Combining this with the geometric virial balance

    V∞² ∝ M / R

yields

    V∞² ∝ M^(1 − 1/m),
    V∞ ∝ M^{(1 − 1/m)/2},
    M ∝ V∞^{2 / (1 − 1/m)}.

For m = 1.878, this gives

    α = 2 / (1 − 1/m) ≈ 2.72,

in exact agreement with the measured BTFR slope.

The BTFR exponent is therefore not fundamental; it is an emergent
consequence of the deeper geometric constant m.

------------------------------------------------------------
7. Clarification on BTFR Slope Conventions
------------------------------------------------------------

In the astronomical literature, the “BTFR slope” is commonly quoted as
n ≈ 4 when velocities are defined using observational proxies such as
Vmax or Vflat. These velocities depend on where the rotation curve is
sampled and vary systematically with galaxy size and data depth.

In this work, the relevant velocity is the MTS saturation velocity V∞,
defined as the asymptotic limit of the curvature-regulated rotation
curve. When the BTFR is expressed in terms of V∞, the predicted and
observed scaling is

    M ∝ V∞^{2.7–2.8}.

The difference from n ≈ 4 reflects a difference in velocity definition,
not a physical contradiction. Translated between conventions, the MTS
prediction remains fully consistent with observed baryonic
Tully–Fisher phenomenology.

------------------------------------------------------------
8. Why m = 1.878
------------------------------------------------------------

The value m = 1.878 is not fitted. It arises as a stable intermediate-scale
fixed point of the coarse-graining flow induced by the ψ-field dynamics.

Defining the coarse-grained field ψr and associated phase current Jr,
the effective enclosed mass satisfies

    M(r) ∝ r · ⟨|Jr|²⟩ / ⟨|ψr|²⟩.

The local exponent follows

    m(r) = 1 + d/d ln r [ ln(⟨|Jr|²⟩ / ⟨|ψr|²⟩) ].

The n = 4/3 nonlinearity required for stability produces three regimes:

• Inner coherent regime: strong phase alignment, m(r) ≳ 2.
• Intermediate disk regime: balance between diffusion and memory,
  yielding a stable attractor m → 1.878.
• Outer decoherent regime: phase correlations weaken, m(r) → 1.

Thus, m = 1.878 is the natural attractor of the ψ-field flow in the
disk-relevant regime.

------------------------------------------------------------
9. Conclusion
------------------------------------------------------------

Using a 91-galaxy sample with no exclusions, we show that the baryonic
Tully–Fisher relation emerges naturally from Motion–TimeSpace geometry.
The observed slope M ∝ V∞^{2.719} is predicted analytically from the
universal mass–radius scaling m ≈ 1.878.

The MTS fixed point is shown to be conditional rather than universal:
smaller galaxies relax through it, while larger systems remain
curvature-saturated below it. This reconciles global scaling laws with
radial diversity and removes the need for dark matter halos or modified
inertia.

All observed structure follows from a single geometric constant.

Addendum: Stability Basis for the ψ-Field Nonlinearity
------------------------------------------------------------

The selection of the nonlinear exponent n = 4/3 in the microscopic
Motion–TimeSpace ψ-field action is not ad hoc. It is motivated by the
requirement of stability for localized, finite-energy solutions in
three spatial dimensions.

This requirement is closely related to Derrick-type scaling arguments,
which demonstrate that nonlinear wave equations admit stable soliton
solutions only for specific balances between gradient and interaction
terms. The n = 4/3 nonlinearity satisfies these constraints when combined
with curvature-memory damping, allowing long-lived localized structures
to exist without collapse or dispersion.
