Abstract
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We present a compact geometric framework for describing the large-scale
structure and kinematics of rotationally supported disk galaxies within
the Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) approach. Using empirical scaling relations
previously identified in high-quality rotation-curve data, we show that
the total baryonic mass of a galaxy acts as a primary control parameter
for its characteristic radii and asymptotic rotation speed.

We derive a minimal set of power-law relations linking baryonic mass to
star-formation extent, disk size, and velocity saturation, and test
these relations against several landmark galaxies (M33, the Milky Way,
and M31). Deviations from the geometric predictions are shown to correlate
systematically with known structural features such as bars, bulges, and
diffuse low-surface-brightness disks.

The results suggest that while local baryonic rearrangements introduce
order-10% scatter, the global structure of equilibrium disk galaxies is
well described by a small number of geometric scaling laws.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Disk galaxies exhibit remarkably regular scaling relations linking mass,
size, and rotation velocity, despite substantial diversity in morphology,
environment, and star-formation history. Traditional interpretations
often attribute this regularity to halo structure and baryon–halo
coupling, while treating deviations as system-specific complexity.

The Motion–TimeSpace (MTS) framework approaches this problem from a
geometric perspective, treating galactic structure as the outcome of
curvature-diffusion dynamics that reach equilibrium above a characteristic
baryonic mass threshold. In this regime, galaxies converge toward a
universal mass–radius exponent with limited scatter.

This paper consolidates these results into a single “universal profile”
and evaluates its performance against well-studied nearby galaxies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The MTS Universal Profile
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We consider galaxies whose total baryonic mass M_b exceeds the threshold
for approximate virial equilibrium (M_b ≳ 5 × 10⁹ M☉). In this regime,
the enclosed mass profile is empirically well approximated by:

    M(r) ∝ r^m ,   with   m = 1.878 ± 0.064

This exponent defines the geometric backbone of the MTS disk profile.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Characteristic Radii
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Expressing baryonic mass in units of 10⁹ M☉, we define:

Star-formation radius:
    R₉₀ = 2.40 · M_b^0.323   kpc

Observed disk edge:
    R_last = 3.10 · M_b^0.369   kpc

These relations reflect observational definitions rather than pure
dynamical radii and therefore differ slightly from the inverse of m.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 Velocity Scaling
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The asymptotic rotation speed follows:

    V_∞ = 45.1 · M_b^0.344   km s⁻¹

The rotation curve is modeled by a saturation form:

    v(r) = V_∞ [1 − exp(−(2.3 / R₉₀) r)]

The numerical factor ln(10) ≈ 2.3 ensures that R₉₀ corresponds to the
radius at which 90% of the asymptotic velocity is reached.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Benchmark Galaxies
---------------------------------------------------------------------

We apply the universal profile to three well-studied Local Group spirals.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 M33 (Triangulum)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Baryonic mass: M_b ≈ 3.25 × 10¹⁰ M☉  
Predicted V_∞ ≈ 149 km s⁻¹  
Observed V_max ≈ 120–130 km s⁻¹  

M33 rotates more slowly than predicted for its mass. This behavior is
consistent with its relatively diffuse mass distribution and extended
HI disk. Within the MTS framework, M33 appears to reach velocity
saturation less efficiently, consistent with low surface density and
partial curvature diffusion.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 The Milky Way
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Baryonic mass: M_b ≈ 6.5 × 10¹⁰ M☉  
Predicted V_∞ ≈ 188 km s⁻¹  
Observed V_max ≈ 220–230 km s⁻¹  

The Milky Way exhibits higher rotation speeds than predicted by the
geometric baseline. This is plausibly associated with its central bar
and bulge, which concentrate baryonic mass and steepen the inner
curvature gradient, increasing the measured rotation speed near R₉₀.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 M31 (Andromeda)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Baryonic mass: M_b ≈ 1.95 × 10¹¹ M☉  
Predicted V_∞ ≈ 275 km s⁻¹  
Observed V_max ≈ 260–270 km s⁻¹  

M31 shows close agreement with the universal profile. Its large size
appears to average over local irregularities, allowing the underlying
geometric scaling to dominate.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Interpretation of Deviations
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Residuals relative to the universal profile follow systematic trends:

• Galaxies above the geometric prediction typically show enhanced
  central mass concentration (bars or bulges).

• Galaxies below the prediction tend to have diffuse or low-surface-
  brightness disks with extended mass distributions.

• Systems near the prediction appear close to geometric equilibrium.

Across a 90-galaxy sample, the standard deviation of velocity residuals
is approximately 12–15%, indicating that local structure introduces
scatter without destroying the global scaling.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
5. A Geometric Ratio
---------------------------------------------------------------------

An additional empirical result is the ratio:

    R_last / R₉₀ ≈ 1.3

In equilibrium disks, the HI-defined structural edge typically extends
about 30% beyond the radius where velocity saturation is reached. This
may represent a geometric stability margin separating star-forming and
non-star-forming regions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Physical Bounds
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Within the stated regime of applicability:

• Equilibrium disk galaxies do not significantly exceed their predicted
  V_∞ without measurable central mass concentration.

• Star formation declines when the curvature-diffusion field falls below
  the R₉₀ threshold.

• Mean surface density varies weakly with mass, contributing to the
  observed similarity in surface brightness across disk galaxies.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Limitations and Scope
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The universal profile is not expected to apply without modification to:

• Ultra-dwarf galaxies below the virialization threshold  
• Strongly interacting or merging systems  
• Heavily stripped cluster remnants  

In these cases, deviations are physically meaningful and reflect
non-equilibrium structure rather than failure of the geometric baseline.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Conclusion
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A small set of geometric scaling relations derived within the MTS
framework provides a compact description of disk galaxy structure and
kinematics. While individual galaxies exhibit measurable deviations
associated with internal structure and evolutionary state, the overall
regularity of mass–radius–velocity relations suggests the presence of an
underlying geometric organization.

Future work should test these relations against larger samples, explore
their redshift dependence, and examine their connection to environmental
processing and galaxy evolution.
